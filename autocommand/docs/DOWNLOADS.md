# Download history across the AutoCommand repositories

Snapshot taken `2026-11-01T03:43:35Z` (UTC), after the AutoCommand III consolidation into this
repository. Both AutoCommand II and III history, tags and releases now live here.

**Release retention policy:** one release per publish-day (the day's latest) is kept with
its binaries; older same-day releases remain as git tags with notes in [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.txt),
and their binaries are not re-hosted.

> These numbers are **asset requests recorded by GitHub** - raw hits on release-asset URLs,
> not unique users. Source archives, clones, and mirrors are not counted. GitHub cannot
> migrate counters, so re-uploaded assets start at zero; this file preserves the true
> history. The full per-asset record lives in
> [download-history.json](download-history.json) (earlier captures kept in git history).

## Migration notes

- Re-created releases were byte-identical: every zip matched the `SHA256SUMS.txt` published
  with it before upload.
- Same-day releases pruned under the retention policy above keep their tags; the tags pin
  every commit, so no history is lost.
- Old deep links keep working: the source repos are renamed (not deleted), so GitHub
  redirects `/releases/download/...` URLs.
