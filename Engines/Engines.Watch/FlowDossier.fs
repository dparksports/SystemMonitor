// Traffic Peek engine: the Process Monitor's "Peer into this connection"
// action. While one peek window is open, a FlowDossierService holds the
// shared TcpStreamCaptureService via AddRef/Release (it runs for nobody
// else today), filters every finalized TCP flow to the peered subject,
// runs it through the TLS decryptor, and hands the result to the view.
//
// A subject is one of three scopes:
//   RemoteIpScope  — one remote IP ("this connection")
//   ProgramScope   — one program instance, matched by the PID Sysmon EID 3
//                    attributes (never image-matched for shared hosts)
//   ServiceScope   — a svchost-hosted service name (DiagTrack, CryptSvc…),
//                    matched by resolving each connecting PID's hosted
//                    services — the pin survives service restarts, where
//                    a PID-anchored scope would go stale
//
// Honesty rules (same vocabulary the Transmissions pipeline uses):
//   • TLS metadata (SNI/ALPN/cipher) is always extracted from the
//     ClientHello — keys or no keys.
//   • Plaintext appears only when session keys exist in the keylog.
//     schannel services (wuauserv, bits, DoSvc …) never log keys, so
//     their rows stay metadata-only and say exactly why.
//   • Nothing is persisted: PersistFlows stays off, entries are
//     fire-and-forget events. The capture lives exactly as long as the
//     window that asked for it.
//
// PID attribution rides Sysmon EID 3 via this service's own
// SysmonConnectWatcherService feeding TagFlow — first-writer-wins, so a
// future pipeline doing the same is harmless.
